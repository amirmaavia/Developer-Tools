## *4 Must Have Free Tools for Developers*
#### **work Smart not Hard**

## 1. Bundlephobia 
 A lot of developers use several libraries or dependencies in their projects. This can give you certain functionality without much trouble. However, it can add to your bundle size and thus increase loading times. We have to make a wise decision on which dependencies to use and whether to use them or not.



 [Bundlephobia](https://bundlephobia.com/) is a great tool that lets you know the bundle size of your packages. Bundlephobia tells you the minified size, minified and gzipped size, as well as the download time on varying download speeds. Just search for the node package you want to add or paste the JavaScript code directly into it. It also tells if the bundle uses some other dependencies in terms of composition.

 ## 2. Cloudcraft

 [Cloudcraft](https://www.cloudcraft.co/)is a tool to help you with your cloud architecture in a quick and efficient way. You can plan your project with drag and drop isometric or 2D architecture diagrams on its visual designer interface.



 Although it is optimized for AWS, but you can plan any cloud environment you like to work. You can also collaborate with your team and export the plan as presentations or wikis. Cloudcraft shows real-time project budget automatically as you draw. So you can have an idea of budget and plan it accordingly.

  ## 3. Figma 

  [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is a design tool. And it is hard for me to believe that this tool with professional standards is free. Figma has a desktop app as well as a web app version. A developer can use it to make an initial prototype of the final project. I recommend Figma because design tools like Adobe Illustrator can be expensive for a lot of developers especially when you are a beginner.

  The thing I love about Figma the most is that you can design directly in the editor and then copy CSS styles or android code it provides additionally. This makes the design part so efficient as it reduces a lot of trial process.

  ## 4. FontFlipper

  [FontFlipper](https://fontflipper.com/) is a a great resource that lets you choose free fonts for your designs if you do not have much knowledge of design fundamentals and font pairing. You can just upload your design and check how different fonts look. It suggests fonts that pair with your original design, and once satisfied, you can download them.
